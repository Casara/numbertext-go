#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Compiles every self-contained Go program embedded in the project's
# Markdown, against numbertext-go in this working tree.
#
# Why this exists: `make check` proves the code is correct, not that the
# documentation still describes it. A README snippet that stopped compiling
# three commits ago looks exactly like one that still works. This closes
# that gap for the blocks that *can* be closed.
#
# What it verifies: every ```go block whose first line is `package main`.
# Those are complete programs (today: the Usage/Regional variants/Gender
# examples in README.md and README.pt-BR.md that are full programs rather
# than fragments).
#
# What it deliberately does NOT verify: illustrative fragments - a bare
# statement, a struct literal, a snippet meant to be read alongside
# surrounding prose (e.g. the "gb, _ := ..." block under "Regional
# variants", which continues the Usage example's imports rather than
# repeating them). Those are pedagogically right as fragments and can
# never compile standalone. They are counted and reported so the
# unverified surface stays visible instead of being silently assumed
# correct.
